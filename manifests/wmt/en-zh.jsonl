But how did they survive? Scientists at the John Innes Centre may have found out. Land plants survive by getting water and nutrients from the soil. They do this by forming a special friendship with soil-dwelling fungi called mycorrhiza. These strands of mycorrhiza reach deep into the soil and drag the nutrients and water back to the plants. But when the first algae landed on soil, how did they survive long enough to form these beneficial friendships?", "tgt_ref": "大约4亿5千万年前，植物从海洋一跃来到陆地，成为我们今天所熟悉和喜爱的植物。但它们是如何生存下来的呢？约翰英纳斯中心的科学家们可能已经找到了答案。陆地植物靠从土壤中汲取水分和养料生存。它们通过与一种叫做菌根的土栖真菌建立特殊的盟友关系来做到这一点。这些菌根深入土壤，将养料和水分送回植物体内。但是，第一批藻类降落在土壤上时，又是如何存活足够长的时间来形成这一盟友关系的呢？", "src_lang": "en", "ref_lang": "zh", "benchmark_metadata": {"doc_id": "test-en-speech_OyCyIOEyL20_000", "dataset_type": "longform"}}

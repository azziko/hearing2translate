If perlini's going to win this one, she needs to be defensive and get everything back against sabalenka and hope that sabalenka maybe throws in a few errors after a long extended rally because we can see that that happens sometimes when perlini is playing types of players that do have big shots. If sabalenka's going to win this one, she needs to serve well and be patient and realize that there is going to be a lot of shots coming back and she's going to have to probably hit two, three, four extra shots each rally, so she's going to have to be patient and she's going to get the win.

The guide actually points out things like this machine's cactus or spit the dummy or even bring a plate as terms that won't be well understood and perhaps worth avoiding.

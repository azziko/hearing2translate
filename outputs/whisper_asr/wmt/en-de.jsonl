So we can technically subtract that from this 15, 75, 76. So here's what I want you to do. I don't want you to go cold turkey just yet. But what I would recommend is pretend is that we're going to subtract that we're going to do 2600 minus 15, 76, 15, 75, 76. Right. Because there's always the human error in that you might have miscalculated something or I might have. So we're going to pretend like everything is the way it was. And this is how much you're going to be paying. This is where the budgeting is really handy. So we're going to do 2600 minus that number. What I have is $1,024.24. So"}

Well, that wide line to a lefty batsman's behind his legs, and that's a wide. So that's runs. And they ran on everything. Meanwhile, Pakistan running on nothing, doing nothing to force extra runs. Look at this. You can see the difference here of where their body is, how it's presented to the umpire. And that's the difference. They just turned everything into runs. They knew that they were going after that wide line and they knew when to go after it, get the boundary, when to leave it. Good job, Team USA."}

It doesn't fit because sometimes taper holders are a bit larger. There's different sizes of taper candles, but there is an easy workaround if you have a taper candle and a holder that you really want to use. And that is simply to melt the bottom side of your taper candle with a lighter or a match and let the wax drip into the taper candle holder. And as it's still hot, press it into the holder and it's actually going to melt into the holder and kind of stand in the exact position that you want it to. And's just say you make it a bit crooked when you stick it in don't worry you can pull it right out re-melt it and at some point you're going to get it straight enough to where you like it and it's going to be stuck in the holder pretty well my next tip is to remove a sticker residue from your decor pieces now i know that there's the whole low dryer tip to kind of like heat it up and remove the sticker which is great but i always feel like there's still like a little bit of film"}
